# python-for-kids
Jupyter Notebook based lessons to teach my kids Python

# !!!This is a work in progress!!!

## Getting Started

To get started Navigate to a lesson in the lesson folder and select the lesson-xx.ipynb file. Then at the top of the page click the Open in Colab badge.

If you are new, and want to start at the beginning you can click here:

## Why I am creating this

My kids spend way too much time surfing Youtube videos. I think that they should be using computers to learn more than play. One has an old macbook, and the other two have PC's. The older two also have Chromebooks from school which they cannot install things on. 

So the easiest way to create a lesson plan, as well as execute python snippets is Jupyter Notebooks.

Since they cannot install python on their Chromebooks, and they have various different platforms, Google Colab seems to be the easiest deployment of Jupyter they can all use easily.

This project will be hosted on Github, dynamically pull and install whatever modules and other content is needed from online so that it never trys to install anything on the local machine.
