    "In this lesson, you will learn the basics of using Jupyter Notebook, including how to run code cells, create new cells, and restart the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all our lessons happen in Jupyter Notebooks, it's like knowing how to drive a car before going on a road trip. Understanding how Jupyter works will make it easier for you to focus on what we're learning in each lesson.\n",

    "**2. Navigating the Jupyter Interface**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a Jupyter Notebook, you'll see an interface with a menu at the top and an area below where you can add and run code cells. It's like a word document mixed with a code playground.\n",

    "- Click on a code cell (the gray box).\n",
    "- Press Shift + Enter or click the \"Run\" button in the toolbar.\n",
    "- Watch the magic happen! Your code will run, and any output will appear below the cell."
