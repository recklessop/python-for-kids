    "**Objective:** \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will understand the concept of variables, different data types in Python, how to declare and use variables, and perform basic arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics Covered\n",
    "1. Introduction to Variables\n",
    "2. Data Types\n",
    "3. Declaring and Using Variables\n",
    "4. Printing Variables\n",
    "5. Basic Arithmetic Operations\n",

    "## Lesson Content\n",
    "**1. Introduction to Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're organizing your room, and you use different boxes to store your stuff. Each box has a label, like \"Toys,\" \"Books,\" or \"Clothes.\" In Python, we have something similar called **variables**. They're like labeled boxes where we store different kinds of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we deal with different types of information, just like you have toys, books, and clothes. These types are called **data types**. Let's look at three of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integer (int):** This is for whole numbers, like your age. For example, if you're 16 years old, we use an integer to represent that, like `age = 16`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **String (str):** Think of this as text, like your name. If your name is Alice, we use a string to represent it, like `name = \"Alice\"`. You can use single or double quotes for strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Float (float):** This is for numbers with decimals, like 3.14. If you have a favorite number like 3.14, we use a float to represent it, like `pi = 3.14`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Declaring and Using Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how to use variables. To use a variable, you need to do two things: **declare** it and **assign** a value to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Declaring variables\n",
    "age = 16\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "pi = 3.14\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we declared three variables: `age`, `name`, and `pi`, and we assigned values to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, declare two variables: age & name; then set them equal to your name and age.\n"

    "**4. Printing Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "After storing information in variables, we might want to see what's inside. To do that, we use the `print()` function. It's like showing the contents of your boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Printing variables\n",
    "print(\"My age is\", age)\n",
    "print(\"My name is\", name)\n",
    "```\n",

    "**5. Basic Arithmetic Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can also do math for us! We can use it for basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even finding the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic arithmetic operations\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 3\n",
    "sum_result = x + y           # addition\n",
    "difference_result = x - y    # subtraction\n",
    "product_result = x * y       # multiplication\n",
    "division_result = x / y      # division\n",
    "modulus_result = x % y       # mod divide (it returns the remainder after division\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `sum_result` would be 13 (because 10 + 3 = 13), `difference_result` would be 7 (10 - 3 = 7), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, create a couple of variables and then practice some equations. Remember, this will be a two-step process, step 1 is to do the equation, and step 2 is to print the result."
